# Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)

- [Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/security-101/what-is-cspm) identifies and remediates risk by automating visibility, uninterrupted monitoring, threat detection, and remediation workflows to search for misconfigurations across diverse cloud environments/infrastructure, including `Infrastructure as a Service` (`IaaS`), `hSoftware as a Service` (`SaaS`), `Platform as a Service` (`PaaS`).
- `CSPMs` can defend cloud environments against the below with immediate, automated responses:
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- `Misconfigurations`
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- `Legal and regulatory compliance issues`
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- `Unauthorized access`
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- `Insecure Interfaces/APIs`
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- `Account hijacking`
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- `Lack of visibility`
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- `Lack of clarity in project responsibility timeline`
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- `External data sharing`
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- `Improper use and configuration of identities and cloud environments`
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- `Compliance and Regulation Issues`
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- `DDoS and DDoS`
